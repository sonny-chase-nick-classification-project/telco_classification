    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team leader wants us to find out why our customers are churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our team lead would like us to take a look at some of our recent customer data. We've been tasked with identifying areas that represent high customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside from the more general question, *why are our customers churning?* Some other questions we will look to answer: Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases? Is their a negative impact once the price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)? Among numerous other possible questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this particular project she would like to see our code documentation and commenting buttoned-up. In addition, she'd like us to not leave any individual numbers or figures displayed in isolation. Adding context to these situations are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify as many different customer subgroups that have a propensity to churn more than others. Our target audience is our team lead, however, she will be presenting these findings to the Senior Leadership Team. We will need to keep this final audience in mind with regards to report readability, etc. We will need to communicate in a more concise and clear manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables for this project are the following data assets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Report detailing our analysis in an .ipynb format\n",
    "2. A CSV with the customer_id, probability of churn, and the prediction of churn\n",
    "3. Slide Deck explaining our analysis with the SLT audience in mind\n",
    "4. All .py files that are necessary to reproducible work\n",
    "5. Detailed README on a Github and repo containing all files for this project"

    "\n",
    "#### *Target Variable*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**churn** - defines whether or not the customer is still with telco: 0 == still with telco, 1 == they have churned\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Independent Variables*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**gender** - gender identity of customer - 0 = female, 1 = male\n",
    "\n",
    "**senior_citizen** - if the customer is a senior - 0 = not senior citizen, 1 = senior citizen\n",
    "\n",
    "**online_security** - if the customer has online security through telco - 0 = No, 1 = No Internet Service, 2 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**online_backup** - if the customer has online backup through telco - 0 = No, 1 = No Internet Service, 2 = Yes\n",

    "\n",
    "**streaming_movies** - if the cusomter has streaming movie service through telco - 0 = No, 1 = No Internet Service, 2 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**paperless_billing** - if the customer has elected to have a paperless billing format - 0 = No, 1 =Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**monthly_charges** - the monthly charges per customer for all services - represented as a float, calculated in USD\n",
    "\n",
    "**total_charges** - the total lifetime charges per customer for all services - represented as a float, calculated in USD\n",
    "\n",
    "**tenure_years** - tenure of each customer - represented in total years, used the tenure (calculated in months) column from original data pull then divided by 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "**phone_and_multi_line** - a combination of whether a customer has a phone line, and if they do, do they have multiple lines (used the phone_service and multipe_line columns from original pull) - 0 = No phone lines, 1 = Yes, but only one line, 2 = Yes, multiple lines\n",
    "\n",
    "**partner_and_dependents** - a combination of whether a customer has a partner or dependents (used the partner and dependents columns from original pull) - 0 = No partner and No dependents, 1 = Yes, a partner and No dependents, 2 = No partner and Yes, dependents, 3 = Yes, partner and Yes, dependents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electronic check** - the customer pays with Electronic check, one hot encoded from the payment_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mailed check** -the customer pays with Mailed check, one hot encoded from the payment_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit card (automatic)** - the customer pays with Credit card, one hot encoded from the payment_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank transfer (automatic)** - the customer pays with Bank transfer, one hot encoded from the payment_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSL** - the customer has DSL internet service, one hot encoded from the internet_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiber optic** - the customer has Fiber optic internet service, one hot encoded from the internet_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**None** - the customer does not have internet service, one hot encoded from the internet_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Month-to-month** - the customer pays Month-to-month, one hot encoded from the contract_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**One year** - the customer pays Month-to-month, one hot encoded from the contract_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two year** - the customer pays Month-to-month, one hot encoded from the contract_types column from original pull - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Scaling*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min/Max Scaler** - The deliverables requires we proved a model that preforms better than the baseline at predicting customer churn. We'll be using Classification models to make this prediciton. It's possible we'll need to scale the data, generally; however, a model like K Nearest Neighbors requires scaling, so we'll at least be scaling when testing that model."
